This is your no-BS reminder on how to deploy your React app when you havenâ€™t done it in a while.

## ðŸ§­ Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Switch to the `main` branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

### 2. Pull the latest changes (optional but recommended)

```bash
git pull
```

### 3. Install dependencies (especially after a cleanup)

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Build the app

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Deploy the app

#### ðŸ”¹ If using **GitHub Pages**

Make sure your `package.json` has the correct `homepage` and deploy script.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### ðŸ”¹ If using **Vercel**, **Netlify**, etc.

Just push to the `main` branch â€” theyâ€™ll handle the deployment for you.

#### ðŸ”¹ If deploying manually (e.g., to a server or S3)

Upload the contents of the `build/` folder wherever it needs to go.

## ðŸ§¼ Optional Clean Build

If you want to start fresh:

```bash
rm -rf build
```

---

## ðŸ¤” Troubleshooting

-   If `npm run deploy` fails, check your `package.json` scripts.
-   If you're not sure where it's going â€” check the `homepage` field in `package.json`.
